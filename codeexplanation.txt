1:data.txt file
The data file is organized in the following format:
#subject:(This is where the subject name and number goes. The # sign in front of the word "subject:" allows code to identify that it is the start of a appointment)
>tutor:(This is where the tutor name goes)
>client:(This is where the client name goes, when a appointment is made the name is set to "N/A")
>comm:(This is where the email of the tutor goes so when a tutor needs to be contacted they can be)
>date:(This is where the day is placed)
>start:(This is the time the appointment starts)
>end:(This is the time the appointment ends)
>cash:(This is where the amount of cash goes, if there isn't a cost put 0)
>venmo:(This is where the venmo name goes if the user places it)


The appointment numbers are the lines in the data.txt file where there are # signs, representing the start of an appointment.


2:addapp(subject,tutor,comm,date,start,end,cost,venmo)
The addapp function adds an appointment to the data file in the proper format.

The code can have additional lines of data stored per appointment. The only adjustment required is the number of arguements and the appointmentSize variable on top.
The arguements for the function is explained in the data.txt file section.


3:search(query,subject)
The search function looks for a query(such as comm, date, or subject) and tries to match the subject with whatever is at the end of the ":" in the file.
The function returns the appointment numbers of anything that has the correct query and subject.
The function will not return an appointment that has the query but has an incorrect subject.

query=text before ":" disincluding the first character(> or #)
subject=text after ":"


4:getappointment(mynumber)
This function will return a list of all the items in an appointment in a list based on the mynumber being the appointment number.
The function will not work if the line number is not proceded by a #.

appointmentSize variable=the number of lines an appointment takes (currently 9). The number is stored inside the addAppointment file.
mynumber=the appointment number


5:claim(appointmentnumber,client):
This function will claim an appointment.

offset variable=the number of lines down the client is from the #.
appointmentnumber=the appointment # in the data.txt file. Any line number that isn't preceded by a "#" sign is considered invalid and there is no result.
client=the client name that is inserted into the appointment number
